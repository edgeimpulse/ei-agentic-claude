        Test out a pretrained model (using image data) - upload first via 
        `uploadPretrainedModel`.

        If you want to deploy a pretrained model from the API, see
        `startDeployPretrainedModelJob`.

        This will transform raw image data (e.g. RGB to grayscale, resize)
        before classifying.

        To classify raw features, see `testPretrainedModel`.

      description: >
        Verify connectivity to a storage bucket and optionally list its
        contents. This endpoint allows you to:

        1. Check if the provided bucket credentials are valid and the bucket is
        accessible.

        2. Optionally list files in the bucket up to a specified limit.

        3. Validate the bucket configuration before adding it to the
        organization.


        The request can include details such as the bucket name, region,
        credentials, and listing options.

        The response provides information about the bucket's accessibility and,
        if requested, a list of files in the bucket.


        Important note on verification process:

        - For S3-compatible storage backends: Verification is expected to be
        immediate.

        - For Azure buckets: Verification takes longer. Users are required to
        poll this endpoint

        until the connectionStatus changes from 'connecting' to 'connected'.


        When dealing with Azure buckets, implement a polling mechanism to check
        the status

        periodically until it's confirmed as connected.

        Updates storage bucket details. This only updates fields that were set
        in the request body.

        Before updating the bucket details, it is required to verify the
        connection using the

        POST /api/organizations/{organizationId}/buckets/verify endpoint.


        The verification process:

        1. Call the verify endpoint with the new bucket details.

        2. Poll the verify endpoint until it responds with `connectionStatus:
        connected`.

        3. If the endpoint responds with `connectionStatus: error`, the
        verification has failed.


        Only proceed with updating the bucket details after receiving a
        `connected` status.

        The polling interval and timeout should be determined based on your
        application's requirements.

        Workflow:

        1. The client initiates verification by sending a GET request to
        /api/organizations/{organizationId}/buckets/verify with bucket and
        credential details.

        2. The server responds with this VerifyOrganizationBucketResponse
        object.

        3. The client checks the connectionStatus:
           - If "connected": Verification is complete. Other properties (files, hasInfoLabelsFile, signedUrl) are available.
           - If "connecting": Verification is in progress. The client should continue polling. Other properties are not yet available.
           - If "error": Verification failed. Check connectionError for details. Other properties are not available.
        4. If connectionStatus is "connecting", the client should periodically
        poll the endpoint until the status changes to "connected" or "error".
